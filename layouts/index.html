  <h1>Hello, I'm Glasket</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer that's worked professionally on web and desktop 
    applications for {{now.UTC.AddDate -2020 0 0 | time.Format "2006" | int}}+ years.
    I also enjoy dabbling in game development and programming language design as a hobby.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not a language evangelist, and heavily believe that <em>languages are tools</em>.
    This is part of why I've ended up as a polyglot, with experience using C#, Go, Rust, 
    Python, JavaScript, and more.
  </p>
